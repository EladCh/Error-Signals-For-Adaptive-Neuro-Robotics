\section{Project Abstract}

- the importance  of adaptation in robotic systems.
\\- a lot of cases that its crucial (medical, military etc). 
\\- there are some algorithms that handle this task but the novelty at work is that this is the first time (to our knowledge) that this task is attacked    by a neuromorphic approach is
\\- we are interested in neuro-robotics e.i. how neural systems do the adaptation
